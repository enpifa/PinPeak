# PinPeak

This is an app that intends to help the user find out the surrounding mountains. Currently working on an offline version that uses the compass to constantly update the pointing angle. This angles is compared with the rest of the peaks' angles to figure out the peaks that lie in front of the user, and how far these peaks are.
